2 tbsp of butter
1 can of beef broth
4 tbsp of flour
1 8-oz tub of sour cream
salt to taste
4 oz of merlot or similar red wine
6 gloves of garlic
1 tbsp worcestershire sauce

Sautee mushrooms and garlic in butter until softened.
Meanwhile, mix salt and flour in a bowl, and coat each strip of sirloin
thoroughly. Add to vegetable mixture and saute until beef is browned and cooked throughout.
